# Final Project for IDM-111

For this project, we were told to make a website of any topic with several required features. This ended up getting full points for that assignment, and although it's not amazing, I thought it would be nice to have on its own in order to be visited through GitHub Pages. 

All written content was written by me, and any images not created by me are cited.
